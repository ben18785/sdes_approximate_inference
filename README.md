# A tutorial on Bayesian inference for stochastic differential equations using KL-expansions of Brownian motion
This repo holds materials complementary to the preprint [1]. The materials are specifically in the form of a series of R-Markdown notebooks, which requires, amongst other things, that Stan is installed:

- [Explaining KL expansion of Brownian motion](src/kl_expansion_brownian_motion.Rmd)
- [Inference for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process](src/ou_process.Rmd)
- [Inference for the geometric Brownian motion process](src/geometric_brownian_motion.Rmd)
- [Inference for the Wiener velocity process](src/wiener_velocity.Rmd)
- [Inference for the double well difussion process](src/double_well_diffusion.Rmd)
